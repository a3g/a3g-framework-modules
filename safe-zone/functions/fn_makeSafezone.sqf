  Description:
  Makes a safezone, in which guns cannot be shot and grenades cannot be thrown. Does also prevent people from firing or throwing things INTO the safezone. Needs to be run on all machines, including server. Marker needs to be perfect circle, ovals and rectangles intentionally don't work. This is because intersection tests on circles ( spheres really ) are trivial, while intersection tests with rectangles and ovals are not, or simply: Performance reasons.

  Parameter(s):
  #0 STRING - Markername
  #1 (Optional) BOOL - true to show arrows to indicate the extent of the protection zone (default: false)

  Returns:
  BOOL - TRUE when done
